## Craigalytics

This gem allows you to count the number of occurrences of specific keywords across craigslist pages using their rss feeds.

You may notice that it doesn't exist yet, and then you will go read this article: http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html and everything will become clear.

TODO: Actually write this readme and transfer it to a spec, copying the documentation back to this readme as it is implemented.
